In this template:

- The badges at the top provide information about the npm version and license.
- The Features section briefly describes the key features of your package.
- The Installation section provides instructions on how to install your package using npm or Yarn.
- The Usage section gives a quick overview of how to integrate and use your package.

- The Contributing section invites users to contribute to your project and links to a placeholder [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `[LICENSE.md]`, `[CONTRIBUTING.md]`, and `[Auth Kit React Documentation]` with the actual file paths and links. Also, consider adding a detailed documentation file (`docs/README.md`) if your package has complex configuration options or additional features.

Feel free to tailor this template further based on your package's specific features and structure.
